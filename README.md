# SIGN-LANGUAGE-RECOGNITION-AND-TRANSLATION-INTO-TEXT-AND-SPEECH-
This project focuses on the development of a real-time Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The main objective is to bridge the communication gap between the deaf community and the general population by translating sign language gestures into readable text and audible speech.
